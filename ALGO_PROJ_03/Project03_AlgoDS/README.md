# Pattern Matching algorithms
This is a Java implementation of Pattern Matching algorithms. The three algorithms used are:
1. Brute-Force algorithm
2. Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm
3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

# How to run:
1. You need to run the Main.java class. It contains the main() method.
2. Wait for the program to run.
